I finally got around to updating this old thing, or at least get started on it. The reason being that I want to start writing a bit more.
But the problem today is that so many services lock you in and I want to be in control of my own stuff and do it in the way the internet used to work.
So a regular ol' blog build around files that I can move anywhere.

Still the tech behind the scenes isn't as old school and I still wanted to learn something while tinkering with this.

## So what is behind the scenes?

Every developer is a bit obsessed with the tech powering sites and I'm really no different. Settling for something is insanely difficult when there are several options for every problem you want to solve.
So the basics here are...

### NextJS for the frontend

I just needed something quick when I first set this site up and next was the hottest thing (and still is for the most part) so why not just work with what I already have. Considered switching to Remix just to try it out, but that might be something that I might do if it happens to surpass Next in popularity.

### Tailwind for styling

I removed the CSS modules that I was previously using and just went with Tailwind. Just really used to it at this point and can't see myself
using anyting else anytime soon.

### Vercel for hosting

Just to keep it simple. The other option I wanted to try for this was Cloudflare Pages, but again maybe later.

### Content management

This was the hardest part to settle on since there are WAY too many to pick from. But I just wanted to get started so I'm just using Markdown files right now.
Will probably move some of it over to Sanity, Strapi or DatoCMS in the future.
